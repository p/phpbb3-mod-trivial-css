This is a demonstration modification, used in phpBB 3.1 development.

It is intended to be a simplest possible modification that still does
something useful.

The idea is taken from http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=74&t=639205.
This mod will add a css file making prosilver background red, or something
equally trivial and obvious.

The css fragment will be in its own css file. The css file will be included
into phpBB templates via the hook system.
